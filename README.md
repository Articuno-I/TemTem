# TemTem
An open-source TemTem code library

## Purpose
I put a detailed explanation of why I created this library [here](
https://www.playtemtem.com/forums/threads/a-temtem-code-library.9687/#post-50309
).

Previously no code was available, and formulas and mechanics were often tricky
to track down, lacking information, and sometimes I couldn't find them online
at all.

My hope is that an open-source library of TemTem code should allow anyone who
wants to create something TemTem-related can do so much more easily, and be
much more confident that their code will output the correct result.

## Language
Python3.8 was chosen for a number of reasons:
 - It's an easy language to learn and that's the first language many people are
    taught, making this more accessible.
 - It's practically pseudocode, so if you want to use another OO language it
    should be pretty simple to translate over.
 - It's the most fun to use, and the language I'm most used to using.
